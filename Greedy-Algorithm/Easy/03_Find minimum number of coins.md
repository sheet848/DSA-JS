**Problem Statement**: Given a value V, if we want to make a change for V Rs, and we have an infinite supply of each of the denominations in Indian currency, i.e., we have an infinite supply of =={ 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000}== valued coins/notes, what is the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** V = 70
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** We need a 50 Rs note and a 20 Rs note.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** V = 121
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We need a 100 Rs note, a 20 Rs note and a 1 Rs coin.

# Solution

To find the minimum number of coins required to make a specific amount, the **greedy algorithm** can be used if the coin denominations allow it (standard denominations like 1, 5, 10, 25, etc.). Here's a JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function minCoins(coins, amount) {
    // Sort the coin denominations in descending order
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let count = 0; // Count of coins used
    let remainingAmount = amount;

    for (let coin of coins) {
        if (remainingAmount === 0) break;

        if (remainingAmount >= coin) {
            // Calculate how many coins of this denomination can be used
            let numCoins = Math.floor(remainingAmount / coin);
            count += numCoins;
            remainingAmount -= numCoins * coin;
        }
    }

    // If remainingAmount is greater than 0, we cannot form the amount with the given coins
    if (remainingAmount > 0) {
        return -1; // Indicating no solution
    }

    return count; // Minimum number of coins
}

// Example usage:
const coins = [1, 2, 5, 10];
const amount = 27;

const result = minCoins(coins, amount);
if (result !== -1) {
    console.log(`Minimum number of coins required: ${result}`);
} else {
    console.log("The amount cannot be formed with the given coins.");
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sort Coins**:
    - Start with the largest denomination to minimize the number of coins used.
2. **Iterate and Deduct**:
    - For each coin, calculate how many can fit into the remaining amount and deduct it.
3. **Edge Case**:
    - If the `remainingAmount` isn't zero after considering all denominations, return `-1` to indicate that forming the amount is impossible.

### Example:

For `coins = [1, 2, 5, 10]` and `amount = 27`:

- Use one coin of `10`.
- Use one coin of `10`.
- Use one coin of `5`.
- Use two coins of `1`.

Total: 5 coins.

### Limitations:

The greedy approach works only if the coin denominations are such that the largest denominations lead to an optimal solution. If the coin set includes denominations like 3, 7, or irregular combinations, this may fail. A dynamic programming approach can be used for those cases.
