The **N Meetings in One Room** problem is a classic **Greedy Algorithm** problem. The objective is to schedule as many meetings as possible in a single room, ensuring no meetings overlap.

### **Approach**:

1. **Sort Meetings by End Time**:
    - To maximize the number of meetings, sort them based on their ending time.
2. **Select Meetings Greedily**:
    - Iterate through the sorted meetings and select a meeting if its start time is greater than or equal to the end time of the last selected meeting.

### **JavaScript Implementation**:

```javascript
function maxMeetings(start, end) {
    const meetings = start.map((s, i) => ({
        start: s,
        end: end[i],
        index: i + 1
    }));

    // Sort meetings by their end time
    meetings.sort((a, b) => a.end - b.end);

    const result = [];
    let lastEndTime = 0;

    for (let meeting of meetings) {
        // Select the meeting if it doesn't overlap with the previous one
        if (meeting.start >= lastEndTime) {
            result.push(meeting.index); // Store the index of the selected meeting
            lastEndTime = meeting.end; // Update the last end time
        }
    }

    return result; // Return the indices of selected meetings
}

// Example usage:
const startTimes = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5];
const endTimes = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9];

console.log("Maximum meetings:", maxMeetings(startTimes, endTimes));
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Input**:
    - Two arrays: `start` (start times) and `end` (end times) of meetings.
2. **Sorting**:
    - Meetings are sorted based on their end time.
3. **Greedy Selection**:
    - Iterate through sorted meetings and select the next valid meeting (i.e., a meeting whose start time is â‰¥ the end time of the last selected meeting).
4. **Output**:
    - The indices of meetings that can be conducted in the room.

### Example:

For `start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]` and `end = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]`:

- Sorted by end times: [(1, 2), (3, 4), (0, 6), (5, 7), (8, 9), (5, 9)]
- Selected meetings: 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th.
- Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`.

### **Time Complexity**:

- Sorting the meetings: **O(n log n)**.
- Iterating through meetings: **O(n)**.
- Total: **O(n log n)**.
