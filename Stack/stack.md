# Stack
- A stack is a fundamental data structure in computer science that follows the [Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lifo-principle-in-stack/). 
- This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
- Stacks are widely used in various applications, such as function call management, undo mechanisms, and parsing expressions.

# What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that allows operations to be performed at one end, called the ****top****. The two primary operations are:

1. ****Push****: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. ****Pop****: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
## Extreme Conditions in a Stack

1. **Stack Underflow**:
	- Occurs when you try to perform a pop or peek operation on an empty stack.
	- **Handling**: Check if the stack is empty before performing these operations.
2. **Stack Overflow**:
	- Occurs when you try to push an element into a stack that has reached its maximum capacity (in languages or implementations where the stack size is fixed).
	- **Handling**: Check if the stack is full before performing a push operation.
## Operations Performed on a Stack

1. ****Push****: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. ****Pop:**** Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
3. ****Peek (or Top)****: Returns the top element without removing it.
4. ****isEmpty:**** Checks if the stack is empty.
5. ****Size****: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
