Here’s an optimal solution to find the **longest palindromic substring** without using dynamic programming (DP). This approach uses the concept of expanding around potential centers:

```javascript
function longestPalindrome(s) {
    if (s.length <= 1) return s; // Single character or empty string is a palindrome

    let start = 0, maxLength = 0;

    // Function to expand around the center
    const expandAroundCenter = (left, right) => {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
            const currentLength = right - left + 1;
            if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = currentLength;
                start = left;
            }
            left--;
            right++;
        }
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        // Expand around odd-length palindrome (single character center)
        expandAroundCenter(i, i);

        // Expand around even-length palindrome (two character center)
        expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1);
    }

    return s.substring(start, start + maxLength);
}

// Example Usage:
const input = "babad";
console.log(longestPalindrome(input));
// Output: "bab" or "aba"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Expand Around Centers**:
   - A palindrome is symmetric around its center.
   - Each character and each pair of consecutive characters can be considered a center.
   - Expand outward from each center as long as the characters on both sides match.

2. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome**:
   - Keep track of the start index and the length of the longest palindromic substring found so far.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: **O(n²)** in the worst case, as for every character or pair of characters, the expansion checks all characters in the substring.
   - **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

This approach avoids using a DP table and directly computes the solution through expansion, making it more intuitive and space-efficient. Let me know if you’d like to explore any part further!
