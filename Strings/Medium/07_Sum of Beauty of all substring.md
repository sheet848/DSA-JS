The "sum of beauty of all substrings" problem typically asks us to calculate the beauty of every substring of a given string and then sum them up. Here's a solution for it, assuming the **beauty** of a string is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum frequency of characters in it:

### Optimal Solution in JavaScript

```javascript
function beautySum(s) {
    let totalBeauty = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const freqMap = new Array(26).fill(0); // Frequency map for characters
        for (let j = i; j < s.length; j++) {
            const charIndex = s[j].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
            freqMap[charIndex]++;

            // Compute beauty for this substring
            const maxFreq = Math.max(...freqMap);
            const minFreq = Math.min(...freqMap.filter(count => count > 0));

            totalBeauty += (maxFreq - minFreq);
        }
    }

    return totalBeauty;
}

// Example Usage:
const input = "aabcb";
console.log(beautySum(input)); 
// Output: 17
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nested Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over all possible starting points of substrings.
   - The inner loop iterates over all possible ending points for the current starting point, forming all substrings.

2. **Frequency Map**:
   - A fixed-size array of 26 elements (for lowercase English letters) is used to track the frequency of characters in the current substring.

3. **Calculate Beauty**:
   - For each substring, compute the maximum frequency (`maxFreq`) and minimum non-zero frequency (`minFreq`), and add the difference to the total.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n² × 26) ≈ O(n²), where `n` is the length of the string, and 26 is the constant size of the alphabet.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(26) = O(1), as the frequency map size is constant.
