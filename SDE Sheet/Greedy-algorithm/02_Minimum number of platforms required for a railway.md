The **minimum number of platforms** required for a railway station can be determined using a **greedy algorithm** by analyzing the arrival and departure times of trains. Here’s how you can solve this problem optimally:

---

### **Approach**:

1. **Sort Arrival and Departure Times**:
    - First, sort the arrival and departure times of trains independently.
2. **Use Two Pointers**:
    - Use one pointer for arrivals and another for departures.
3. **Count Platforms**:
    - Iterate through the sorted times, and at any time, keep track of how many trains are at the station simultaneously. The maximum value of this count during the iteration is the minimum number of platforms needed.

### **JavaScript Implementation**:

```javascript
function findMinimumPlatforms(arrivals, departures) {
    // Sort both arrays
    arrivals.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    departures.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let platformsNeeded = 0;
    let maxPlatforms = 0;

    let i = 0; // Pointer for arrivals
    let j = 0; // Pointer for departures

    // Traverse both arrays
    while (i < arrivals.length && j < departures.length) {
        if (arrivals[i] <= departures[j]) {
            // A train has arrived, increment platforms needed
            platformsNeeded++;
            i++;
        } else {
            // A train has departed, decrement platforms needed
            platformsNeeded--;
            j++;
        }

        // Track the maximum platforms needed at any time
        maxPlatforms = Math.max(maxPlatforms, platformsNeeded);
    }

    return maxPlatforms;
}

// Example usage:
const arrivals = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800];
const departures = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000];

console.log("Minimum Number of Platforms Required:", findMinimumPlatforms(arrivals, departures));
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Sort Times**:
    - Sorting ensures that arrival and departure times are processed in chronological order.
2. **Two Pointers**:
    - Use one pointer (`i`) to iterate through arrivals and another (`j`) for departures.
3. **Platform Count**:
    - Increment the platform count when a train arrives.
    - Decrement the platform count when a train departs.
4. **Track Maximum**:
    - Keep track of the maximum platform count during the iteration, which gives the result.

### **Example**:

For `arrivals = [900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]` and `departures = [910, 1200, 1120, 1130, 1900, 2000]`:

- Sort arrivals: `[900, 940, 950, 1100, 1500, 1800]`
- Sort departures: `[910, 1120, 1130, 1200, 1900, 2000]`
- Simulation:
    - At 900 → Platform count = 1
    - At 940 → Platform count = 2
    - At 950 → Platform count = 3
    - At 910 → Platform count = 2
    - At 1120 → Platform count = 1
    - Max platforms needed: **3**

### **Time Complexity**:

- Sorting: **O(n log n)**.
- Traversing arrivals and departures: **O(n)**.
- Total: **O(n log n)**.

### **Space Complexity**:

- **O(1)**, as no additional data structures are used apart from the input.

This is an optimal solution using the greedy approach. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or examples!
