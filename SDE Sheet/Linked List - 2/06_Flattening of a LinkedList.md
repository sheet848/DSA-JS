Flattening a linked list typically involves transforming a nested linked list structure into a single-level list. For example, if each node contains a reference to another linked list, the goal is to merge all the lists into one flattened list.

Here’s the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.next = null;
        this.child = null; // Represents a sub-linked list
    }
}

// Function to flatten the linked list
function flattenLinkedList(head) {
    if (!head) return null;

    let current = head;

    while (current) {
        if (current.child) {
            // Find the tail of the child list
            let tail = current.child;
            while (tail.next) {
                tail = tail.next;
            }

            // Connect the tail of the child list to the next node of the current list
            tail.next = current.next;

            // Connect the child list to the current node
            current.next = current.child;

            // Remove the child pointer (optional)
            current.child = null;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    return head;
}

// Function to display the flattened list
function displayList(head) {
    let current = head;
    while (current) {
        process.stdout.write(current.value + " -> ");
        current = current.next;
    }
    console.log("null");
}

// Example usage:
const head = new Node(1);
head.next = new Node(2);
head.next.next = new Node(3);

head.child = new Node(4);
head.child.next = new Node(5);

head.next.child = new Node(6);
head.next.child.next = new Node(7);

console.log("Flattened List:");
const flattenedList = flattenLinkedList(head);
displayList(flattenedList);
```

### Explanation:

1. **Child Links**:
    - Each node may contain a `child` pointer that represents another linked list.
2. **Flattening Logic**:
    - For each node, if it has a `child`, append the child list to the current node’s `next`, and ensure connections are properly adjusted.
    - Find the tail of the child list and link it to the current node’s `next`.
3. **Result**:
    - The entire nested structure is transformed into a single-level linked list.

This implementation has a **time complexity of O(n)**, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the flattened list. Let me know if you'd like help testing or enhancing this further!
