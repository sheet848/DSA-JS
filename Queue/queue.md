# Queue
- A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. 
- Elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.

## Queue Operations
- **enqueue(item)** – Adds an element to the end of the queue.
- **dequeue()** – Removes and returns the first element from the queue.
- **peek()** – Returns the first element without removing it.
- **isEmpty()** – Checks if the queue is empty.
- **size()** – Returns the number of elements in the queue.
- **clear()** – Removes all elements from the queue.
- **print()** – Prints the elements of the queue.
